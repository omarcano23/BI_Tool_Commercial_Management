📊 Business Intelligence Tool for Commercial Management
A Lean Six Sigma–based BI solution to improve commercial efficiency, information quality, and decision-making in the fishing industry.

📌 Overview
This project is based on my undergraduate thesis:
"Propuesta de una Herramienta de Business Intelligence para Mejorar la Gestión Comercial en una Empresa de la Industria Pesquera" (UNMSM, 2022).

The goal was to design and implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that improves commercial management in a leading fishing industry company operating in Peru and Chile.
The solution integrates process optimization, data modeling, and interactive analytics to address structural inefficiencies in commercial operations.

🎯 Research Motivation
The company faced multiple challenges:
- Decentralized and inconsistent commercial information
- Slow and manual reporting processes
- Limited real-time visibility for decision-making
- Low traceability across quotations, sales, deliveries, and follow-ups
- High dependence on manual Excel workflows

These inefficiencies were validated through:
- Pareto analysis (lost business causes)
- Ishikawa diagrams (root-cause analysis)
- Time-and-motion measurements across commercial processes

🎯 Research Questions
General Question
- How can a Business Intelligence tool improve commercial management in a fishing industry company? 

Specific Questions
- How can a BI tool reduce the duration of the commercial follow-up process?
- How can a BI tool improve satisfaction with commercial information?
- How can a BI tool improve commercial results (sales plan performance)?

🏗️ Project Architecture
The BI framework follows a modular, scalable architecture that integrates ingestion, transformation, validation, and visualization.
